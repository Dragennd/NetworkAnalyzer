The history pane also includes selective columns, allowing for viewing only the data you care about. \n\u00BB Added the ability to resize the window as part of the UI overhaul, in an attempt to make the UI more responsive and easier to use for a variety of display sizes. \n\u00BB Introduced a new settings pane to allow for centralized management of all user-definable settings in the entire app. \n\u00BB Revamped the data being generated by the Latency Monitor to allow for tracking all packets, not just those which were logged via an arbitrary status indicator. \n\u00BB Moved Latency Monitor multi-target definition to the Preset Manager with the introduction of QuickStart if only a single address is needed.",
